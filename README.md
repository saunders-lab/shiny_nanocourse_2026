# Shiny Nanocourse 2026

April 27-28, 2026

UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dept. of Bioinformatics

Instructor: Scott Saunders

TAs: Ermis-Ioannis Michail Delopoulos & Sriya Veerapaneni

  This repository contains lecture and code materials for a two day "nanocourse" on developing Shiny apps. The lectures are available as pdfs in `/lectures` . The code examples are in `/code_examples`. Each example starts with the initial state of a Shiny app file with some instructions as comments, for example `# Add input here {...}`. The corresponding solutions to each example are found in `/code_solutions`. The primary language of instruction is R, but Shiny is now also supported in python. So we have translated the R code examples into python - they are stored in `/python`.
